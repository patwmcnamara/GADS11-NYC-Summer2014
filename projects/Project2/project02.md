# Project 2: Regression

**Project Goals**

*   Predict baseball salaries
*   Accuracy measured by average absolute error --> abs(predicted - actual)

**Your project will demonstrate your ability to:**

* Understand, explain and utilize the supervised learning regression framework
* Identify appropriate features and regression algorithms
* Train a model and adjust features to improve predictive accuracy
* Develop a basic report to explain your process, data and results

**Due Date and Requirements**

*   You'll be presenting your projects in  small groups on July 22nd
*   Expect to see all projects turned in before the beginning of class
*   If you get it to us earlier, we will try to provide early feedback

**Project Requirements**

* Utilize the baseball dataset we discussed in class
* Produce code for feature improvement (transformations, aggregations, etc.), accuracy rates and feature details.
* Submit all code

*   Fundamental Statistics 
*   Python Basics and Using Libraries/Modules
*   Data collection, storage, and manipulation
*   Data visualization in Python
*   Exploratory Data Analysis
*   Intro to Machine Learning
