Investigating the relationship between solar magnetic activity and halo interplanetary coronal mass ejections

An interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is an energetic event in which the sun ejects a large body of plasma along with a frozen in magnetic field configuration into the solar wind. A so called 'halo' event occurs when this ejection appears primarily along the Earth-Sun field of view. It is these events in particular which pose risk to Earth because of the strong association with space weather and geomagnetic storms arising from the ICME's magnetic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. This poses problems for astronauts, satellites, high frequency communications, and may induce currents in any long conductors near the Earth's poles (pipelines, powerlines etc.) It is clearly of interest to understand and predict (hopefully!) these events.

Because of the strong association of CMEs and the solar magnetic field configuration, a natural place to start looking at data is the sun spot cycle (sun spots occur because the twisted magnetic configurations inhibit heat convection and hence the plasma cools appearing dark, especially in hydrogen-alpha line images of the sun). Excellent data on sun spot numbers exists as far back as the 1800s, and more recently the latitude and longitude of sun spot areas on the sun is documented daily. Even better are the vector magnetograms that directly image the magnetic field configuration on the surface for which we have images produced every 15 minutes since 2010. Furthermore we have the LASCO catalogue of CMEs to study which has documented every (observerable/detectable) CME since 1997 and is classified as Halo or not.

I intend to try to combine these data from different sources to:
1) Look at the correlation between sunspots and CME events (nothing new here)
2) Investigate the correlation of sunspot data as a function of position on the solar disc with CME / halo CME events
4) Investigate the magnetic field configurations during active / quiescent times of the solar cycle (11 year cycle)
3) Investigate the magnetic field configurations that lead to CME / halo CME events (eigen-analyses?)
4) (Ambitious) Can we predict the occurrence of a (halo) CME from the vector magnetogram / sunspot configuration data? Or at least given a CME can we predict its size / velocity / direction given the prior state of the magnetic field?

This project will require lots of pandas munging, large amounts of data processing (vector magnetogram images), some PCA, and classification algorithms.

Although this project is primarily academic it actually has far reaching implications for the tech industry. We all rely so heavily on GPS and telecommunications that it is in the interests of many technology providers / governments to be able to predict damaging geomagnetic events from solar activity.
