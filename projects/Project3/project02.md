# Project 2: Classification

**Project Goals**

*   Design a classifier


**Your project will demonstrate your ability to:**

* Follow the ACES framework for Visual Data Exploration (Acquire, Clean, Explore, Subset)
* Understand, explain and utilize the supervised learning classification framework
* Determine and refine meaningful classification challenges
* Identify appropriate features, labels and classification algorithms
* Create and train a classifier and adjust features to improve accuracy
* Develop a basic report to explain your process, data and results


**Due Date and Requirements**

*   Projects will be due on May 14th.

    *   You'll be presenting your projects in small groups on that class day, so come prepared
    *   Expect to see all projects turned in before the beginning of class
    *   If you get it to us earlier, Dave and Ed will try to provide early feedback

**Project Requirements**

* Identify a data set and explain why it is relevant or interesting to you (you may use existing data sets from project 1, find new data, and/or use data you expect to use for your final project)
* Perform the ACES steps in EDA and produce a summary of your results
* Describe a clear classification challenge and determine your algorithm and why you chose it.
* Produce code for classification and feature improvement, including accuracy rates and feature details.
* Prepare a short blog post with images that covers the four points above or a short presentation (something prepared to showcase your work aside from a iPython Notebook)

**You will Submit**
* All code
* All data
* Your blog post
